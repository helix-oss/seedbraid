  Plan and execute a refactoring with safety checks. Uses planner agent, then
  implements incrementally with test/lint verification and code review loop.
  Use only when the user explicitly asks to refactor code.

Plan and execute refactoring: $ARGUMENTS

Current state:
!`git status --short`
!`git diff --stat`

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Planning
1. Spawn the **planner** agent to create a refactoring plan
2. Present the plan summary to the user

### Phase 2: Approval
3. Ask the user to approve before proceeding. If rejected, gather feedback and re-plan (return to Phase 1).

### Phase 3: Implementation + Review Loop (max 3 iterations)
4. Implement changes according to the plan
5. Run verification:
   - Tests: `PYTHONPATH=src uv run --no-editable python -m pytest`
   - Lint: `UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run --no-editable ruff check .`
6. Spawn the **code-reviewer** agent to review all changes
7. Evaluate review results:
   - **Critical = 0 AND Warning = 0** → exit loop, proceed to Phase 4
   - **Issues found** → fix the reported issues, then return to step 5
   - **Iteration 3 reached** → exit loop with remaining issues noted

### Phase 4: Final Report
8. Report summary:
   - Changes made (files modified, lines changed)
   - Review iterations completed
   - Remaining issues (if loop exited at max iterations)
   - Test and lint final status
